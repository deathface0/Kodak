## Kodak Screenshot Tool

Kodak is a lightweight Windows application designed for quick and easy screen capturing. By pressing a specific key combination (`Ctrl + Shift + S`), the tool allows you to select a portion of your screen to capture. The captured area is automatically saved as an image and can be opened in a temporary HTML file for easy viewing. The tool is designed to be unobtrusive, operating in the background and only appearing when activated by the hotkey combination. It also includes a built-in escape mechanism to hide the capture window if necessary.

### Key Features:
- **Hotkey Activation**: Quickly activate the screen capture tool with `Ctrl + Shift + S`.
- **Custom Selection**: Click and drag to select the portion of the screen you want to capture.
- **Image Export**: Automatically encodes the captured image in Base64 format and opens it in a temporary HTML file.
- **Transparency**: The capture window is semi-transparent, allowing you to see the content behind it as you select.
- **Escape Functionality**: Press `Escape` to cancel the selection and hide the tool.

This tool is ideal for anyone who needs a simple and efficient way to capture and share parts of their screen without the need for complex software.
